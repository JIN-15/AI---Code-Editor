# AI Code Editor

## Project Overview

This project involves building an AI-powered code editor on top of the **Judge0 IDE** repository. The goal is to enhance the user experience by integrating AI features such as a chat interface, code suggestions, bug detection, and more. The project is designed to compete with platforms like LeetCode by providing a more interactive and intelligent coding environment.

## Features

1. **Chat Interface**  
   - Users can ask questions and get AI-generated answers directly within the editor.
   - Integrated with a Large Language Model (LLM) for accurate and context-aware responses.

2. **AI-Powered Code Fix Suggestions**  
   - If a user's code fails to compile, the AI will analyze the error and suggest potential fixes.

3. **Inline Code Chat**  
   - Users can select a segment of code and chat with the AI to get explanations, optimizations, or debugging help.

4. **Autocomplete Suggestions**  
   - AI-driven autocomplete suggestions as the user types, improving coding efficiency.

5. **Bug Finder Feature**  
   - The AI can analyze the user's code and identify potential bugs or vulnerabilities.
